        <p>These Cajun-style grilled chicken breasts can be served hot or cold as an entr√©e, on a Caesar salad, or in a sandwich.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dried italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tbsp lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder, to taste</li>
            <li>10 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded into 1/2 inch thickness</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk oil, Cajun seasoning, Italian seasoning, lemon-pepper seasoning, and garlic powder together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Grill chicken on the preheated grill until juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
